## Bypass your annual compliance training

Are you tired of these mandatory video trainings like me? 

Basically, these compliance people treat us like dumbasses (instead, they are),
forcing down your throat videos where a robot speak slower than your local DMV sloth.
Worse, they cannot be accelerated or skipped. (They probably know most normal-minded people would just skip the video.)

A way better solution will be providing these materials on texts, instead of videos. But without such a fancy video platform, how will that uncle of the governor pocket more tax payer money?

### Mechanisms

This script works with SCORM APIs used by websites like Vector Solutions.
Instead of watching the video and taking a quiz, this script directly calls the APIs
to send the server information that you have passed at 100.

There will be no further instructions on its usage, 
nor do I claim the code provided in this repository is suitable for
any particular purpose. 
Please make good use of search engines or ChatGPT.
